# SAAPS
Single Amino Acids Polylimorphism Statistics (SAAPS) is a Python3-based character interface program that can be used and deployed on multiple systems, including Windows, Linux, and MacOS. The software is mainly used to quickly calculate amino acid polymorphism, Shannon information entropy at each site of the sequence, and to analyze sequence features and cluster analysis by using OneHot encoding and dimensionality reduction algorithms.
The raw input file of the SAAPS software is very simple, as long as the sequence file after alignment (nucleotide or amino acid), it can be used for processing and analysis.
